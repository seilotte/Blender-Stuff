# Blender-Shaders

Random group nodes, WIPs I have done over time.
If there's a '-' at the beginning, it means you should open the file.

## Usage
1. Download your desired file from above.
1. Open blender and select `File -> Append`
1. Locate the `.blend` file, `Material or NodeTree -> file_name [APPEND]`
1. Go to the "Shader Editor" or "Compositor", `shift+a -> Group`.

## Credits
- If it's required, it will be inside the ".blend" file.
