# Sei tools

A collection of scripts made into an UI to facilitate my blender workflow.

## Installation
1. Download the `SeiTools.zip` from above.
1. Open blender and select `Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> Install... `
1. Navigate where you downloaded the `.zip` file, `Install Add-on -> Enable it`.
1. If you installed it successfully, it will be in the "n" panel with the name "UmU".

## Guide
- Rig Tools; If an armature is selected, bone settings will show up. ("angavrilov-rigs" needed)
    - Init Rigify; Sets up, bone groups and layer names.
    - Assign Armature; Changes the armature on the modifier and adds or removes the "DEF-" prefix to the vertex groups if it's a rigify rig.
- Mesh Tools; Modifiers I tend to use.
- Data Tools; Change image settings for the selected image nodes.
